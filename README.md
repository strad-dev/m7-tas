# M7 Tool-Assissted Speedrun
This is a Minecraft 1.21.4 server plugin that simulates a perfect run of Master Mode The Catacombs Floor 7 in Hypixel SkyBlock.  **This is not a client-side mod and cannot be used on the real Hypixel server, nor is it in any way associated or affiliated with Hypixel.**

### Prerequisites
- You must have the SkyBlock in Vanilla Minecraft plugin as well, which can be found [here](https://github.com/strad-dev/HypixelSBInVanillaMC/releases/tag/tas).  Alternatively, you can git cloe that repository and compile it yourself, just make sure you are on the 1.21.4 branch.
- You must be using the handcrafted map that I made.  It can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/b6qak5czld0tne4goyiut/M7-TAS-Server.zip?rlkey=6bncspvy79fe98w509v5fxby5&e=1&st=8ed2boym&dl=0).  If you compiled the plugins yourself, you can simply extract the world files and use those.

### Contributing
- If you found a time save or an error, open an issue and describe the error/timesave you found, or make a PR if you can understand my spaghetti code.
- If you want to make a better version of Actions.java and Utils.java, feel free to PR.
