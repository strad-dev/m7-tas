/**
 * Arrow damage (MAP.md §1.0.5).
 * <p>
 * Stat half of a shot is resolved at fire time and stamped on the arrow, so swapping weapons mid-flight changes
 * nothing. Hypixel computes it all at the hit, which is what the arrow-damage tech exploits; we don't reproduce that.
 * <p>
 * Target half (Rulers, Titan Killer, Prosecute, type enchants, target debuffs) isn't knowable at fire time and
 * resolves at {@link #resolve}. Also stamped: weapon name, so the firing reforge decides Precise's headshot bonus,
 * and origin, so Snipe IV's +4% per 10 blocks reads real flight distance.
