 * Classic lets a player focus on movement and routing without keeping up four debuffs and a blessing count. The
 * TAS was reasoned in it; it's the default.
 * <p>
 * <b>Perfect RNG and realistic differ only in what's done BY HAND</b>, never damage. Perfect RNG rolls in your
 * favour: easy terminal boards, Sharp Shooter in the one learnable order, fixed dragon colours, the pet you need is
 * the pet you have. Realistic takes that away: {@link #realPuzzles()} turns on generated terminals, real Simon Says
 * / Arrow Align, rolled Sharp Shooter and dragon orders; {@link #manualPets()} makes you run your own pet menu.
 * <p>
 * Ask {@link #liveInputs()}, never {@code == PERFECT_RNG}, which silently drops realistic to the classic tables.
 * <p>
 * Times across modes aren't comparable, so anything recording a run carries the mode ({@code plugin/RunResult},
 * network leaderboard key).
 * <p>
 * First of the {@code /dungeonsettings}; {@link Mayor} is independent and stacks with any mode.
