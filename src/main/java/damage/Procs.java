/**
 * Damage-over-time procs (MAP.md §7). Each is a separate instance on its own timer: never fold into
 * {@code sumAdditive}, and their instances must not re-trigger themselves.
 *
 * <table>
 *   <caption>The procs</caption>
 *   <tr><th>Source</th><th>Behaviour</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Fire Aspect III</td><td>9% of the hit at ticks 0, 20, 40, 60, 80: five procs over 80t.</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Thunderlord VII</td><td>Every third hit ON THE SAME MOB, 60% of that hit. Not a DoT: fires once on the
 *       hit, state is only the per-target counter.</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Venomous VII</td><td>Each hit adds a stack worth 2% of DPS, cap 40 (80% of DPS), every 20t for 100t.
 *       DPS = 8x the highest hit in the last 100 ticks, so a capped proc is 640% of it. Stop hitting and the stacks
 *       are gone.</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <h2>Refresh</h2>
 * An effect has a cadence ({@code nextTick}, every 20t) and an end time ({@code expiresAt}). A re-hit moves the END
 * TIME only, to {@code now + duration}, and updates the per-tick damage. No damage on the spot, and the 20t phase
 * never moves.
 * <p>
 * Both used to be wrong, together the largest damage bug in the system:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code onHit} dealt an immediate Fire and Venomous instance on EVERY primary hit. A beam lands every 5-7
 *       ticks, so "5 procs over 80t" fired 3-4 times a second on top of its chain; with Venomous the biggest number
 *       in the system, total damage roughly tripled.</li>
 *   <li>Refresh restored a {@code procsLeft} COUNTER instead of extending an end time, i.e. a cooldown reset: the
 *       effect never ended while anyone hit and its phase drifted every proc.</li>
 * </ul>
 * That shared shape is why Fire Aspect and Venomous share one abstraction.
 *
 * <h2>One effect per (ATTACKER, target, kind)</h2>
 * Two players on one mob each run their own Fire and Venomous, own cadence and end time, never refreshing each
 * other's. Inputs are the attacker's too: 9% of THEIR hit, THEIR DPS and stack ramp ({@link CombatState#venomousDps}
 * / {@link CombatState#noteVenomousHit}, keyed on the player).
 * <p>
 * Identity is the attacker's UUID, not the {@link Player}: Bukkit entity equality is entity-ID, which a relog
 * changes, so a reconnected player would start a duplicate beside their own. The effect drops once the UUID lookup
 * comes back empty.
 * <p>
 * All three are sword-only (§7), so bows produce none.
